== Overview

Multus CNI provides the capability to attach multiple network interfaces to pods in {product-name}. 
This gives you flexibility when you need to configure
pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing. 

Multus CNI  is useful in situtations where network isolation is needed, 
including data plane and control plane separation. 
Isolating network traffic is useful for performance and security reasons:

Performance:: You can send traffic along two different planes in order to manage how much traffic is along each plane. 
Security:: You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that must not be shared between tenants or customers. 

All of the pods in the cluster will still use the cluster-wide default network to maintain connectivity across the cluster. 
Every pod has an `eth0` interface which is attached to the cluster-wide pod network. You can view the interfaces for a pod using the [command]`oc exec -it <pod_name> -- ip a` command. If you add additional network interfaces using Multus CNI, they will be named `net1, net2, â€¦, netN`.

To attach additional network interfaces to a pod, you must create configurations which define how the interfaces are attached. 
Each interface is specified using a Custom Resource (CR) that has a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` type. 
A CNI configuration inside each of these CRs defines how that interface will be created. Multus CNI is a "meta plugin" -- a CNI plugin that can call other CNI plugins. This allows the use of other CNI plugins to create additional network interfaces. For high performance networking, use the SR-IOV Device Plugin with Multus CNI. 

Execute the following steps to attach additional network interfaces to pods:

. Create a CNI configuration as a custom resource.
. Annotate the pod with the configuration name.
. Verify that the attachment was successful by viewing the status annotation.

== CNI Configurations

CNI configurations are JSON data with only a single required field, `type`. The configuration in the `additional` field is free-form JSON data, which allows CNI plugins to make the configurations in the form that they require. Different CNI plugins use different configurations. Refer to the documentation specific to the CNI plugin that you wish to use.

An example CNI configuration:

[source,json]
----
{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.0", <1>
  "type": "loopback", <2>
  "additional": "<plugin-specific-json-data>" <3>
}
----

<1> `cniVersion`: Specifies the CNI version that is used. The CNI plugin uses this information to check whether it is using a valid version.
<2> `type`: Specifies which CNI plugin binary to call on disk. In this example, the loopback binary is specified, Therefore, it creates a loopback-type network interface.
<3> `additional`: The `<information>` value provided in the code above is an example. Each CNI plugin specifies the configuration parameters it needs in JSON. These are specific to the CNI plugin binary that is named in the `type` field.
