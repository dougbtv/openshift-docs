= Creating additional network interfaces for the first time

Additional interfaces for pods are defined in CNI configurations that are stored as Custom Resources (CRs).
These CRs can be created, listed, edited, and deleted using the `oc` tool.

The procedure below configures a `macvlan` interface on a pod. This configuration might not apply to all production environments, but you use the same procedure for other CNI plug-ins.

== Creating a CNI configuration for an additional interface as a CR

[NOTE]
====
If you want to attach an additional interface to a pod, the CR that defines the interface must be in the same project (namespace) as the pod.
====

. Create a project to store CNI configurations as CRs and the pods that will use the CRs.
+
----
$ oc new-project multinetwork-example
$ oc project multinetwork-example
----

. Create the CR that will define an additional network interface. Create a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition <2>
metadata:
  name: macvlan-conf <1>
spec:
  config: '{ <3>
      "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
      "type": "macvlan",
      "master": "eth0",
      "mode": "bridge",
      "ipam": {
        "type": "host-local",
        "subnet": "192.168.1.0/24",
        "rangeStart": "192.168.1.200",
        "rangeEnd": "192.168.1.216",
        "routes": [
          { "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" }
        ],
        "gateway": "192.168.1.1"
      }
    }'
----
+
<1> `name` maps to the annotation, which is used in the next step.
<2> `kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition`. This is the name for the CR where this configuration will be stored. It is a custom extension of Kubernetes that defines how networks are attached to pods.
<3> `config`: The CNI configuration is packaged in the `config` field.

The configuration above is specific to a plug-in, which enables `macvlan`. Note the `type` line in the CNI configuration portion.
Aside from the IPAM (IP address management) parameters for networking, in this example the `master` field must reference a network interface that resides on the node(s) hosting the pod(s).

. Run the following command to create the CR:
+
----
oc create -f macvlan-conf.yaml
----

[NOTE]
====
This example is based on a `macvlan` CNI plug-in. Note that in AWS environments, macvlan traffic might be filtered and, therefore, might not reach the desired destination.
====

== Managing the CRs for Additional Interfaces

You can manage the CRs for additional interfaces using the `oc` tool.

To list the CRs for additional interfaces, execute:

----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io
----

Use the following command to delete CRs for additional interfaces:

----
$ oc delete network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io macvlan-conf
----

== Create an annotated pod that uses the CR

To create a pod which uses the additional interface, use an `annotation` that refers to the CR, create a YAML file for a pod:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: samplepod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf <1>
spec:
  containers:
    name: samplepod
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 2000000000000"]
    image: centos/tools
----

<1> The `annotations` field contains `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf`, which correlates to the `name` field in the CR defined earlier.

Run the following command to create the `samplepod` pod:

----
oc create -f samplepod.yaml
----

To verify that an additional network interface has been created and attached to the pod, use the following command to list the IPv4 address information:

----
$ oc exec -it samplepod -- ip -4 addr
----

Three interfaces are listed in the output:

----
$ oc exec -it samplepod -- ip -4 addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1000 <1>
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0@if6: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP  link-netnsid 0 <2>
    inet 10.244.1.4/24 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: net1@if2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN  link-netnsid 0 <3>
    inet 192.168.1.203/24 scope global net1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
----

<1> `lo`: a loopback interface.
<2> `eth0`: the interface that connects to the cluster-wide default network.
<3> `net1`: the new interface that you just created.

=== Attaching multiple interfaces to a pod

To attach more than one additional interface to a pod, specify multiple names, in comma-delimited format, in the `annotation` field in the pod definition.

The following `annotation` field in a pod definition specifies different CRs for the additional interfaces:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf, tertiary-conf, quaternary-conf
----

The following `annotation` field in a pod definition specifies the same CR for the additional interfaces:

[source,yaml]
----
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf, macvlan-conf.
----

== View the interface configuration in a running pod

Once the pod is running, you can can review the configurations of the additional interfaces created.
To view the sample pod from the earlier example, execute the following command.

----
$ oc describe pod samplepod
----

The `metadata` section of the output contains a list of annotations, which are displayed in JSON format:

[source,yaml]
----
Annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status:
    [{
        "name": "openshift-sdn", <1>
        "ips": [
            "10.131.0.10"
        ],
        "default": true,
        "dns": {}
    },{
        "name": "macvlan-conf",
        "interface": "net1", <2>
        "ips": [ <3>
            "192.168.1.200"
        ],
        "mac": "72:00:53:b4:48:c4", <4>
        "dns": {} <5>
    }]
----

<1> `name` refers to the custom resource name, `macvlan-conf`.
<2> `interface` refers to the name of the interface in the pod.
<3> `ips` is a list of IP addresses as assigned to the pod.
<4> `mac` is the MAC address of the interface.
<5> `dns` refers DNS for the interface.

The first annotation, `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan-conf`, refers to the CR created in the example. This annotation was specified in the pod definition.

The second annotation is `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status`.
There are two interfaces listed under `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status`.

* The first interface describes the interface for the default network, `openshift-sdn`. This interface is created as `eth0`. It is used for communications within the cluster.

* The second interface is the additional interface that you created, `net1`. The output above lists some key values that were configured when the interface was created, for example, the IP addresses that were assigned to the pod.
